**iTrust:**

Major tasks in this milestone were related to Build, Testing of iTrust.
We have used Nodejs in order to develop utilities required for this
task. The codebase for these utilities can be found at : \[Fuzzer and
Useless Testcase
Detector\](https://github.ncsu.edu/smsejwan/Devops\_Project/tree/Milestone\_2\_BuildTestAnalysis)

1.  **Setup Build Server for iTrust using Jenkins:**

    1.  Use the knowledge from workshops and homework to set up build
        server for iTrust using Jenkins.

    2.  Write a post hook commit for iTrust so that whenever new commit
        is done to iTrust codebase, build should be triggered
        automatically in Jenkins.

2.  Generate Coverage Report:

    1.  Extend the build definitions for iTrust to include the ability
        to run its test suite, measure coverage, and report the results.

    2.  We have used Jacoco plugin in Maven which generates
        coverage reports. You can find the report available at \[Code
        Coverage Report\](https://github.ncsu.edu/smsejwan/Devops\_Project/tree/Milestone\_2\_BuildTestAnalysis)

3.  Test Case Fuzzer:

    1.  We have developed a tool that automatically commits random
        changes to the source code of iTrust.

    2.  Once these changes are committed, build is triggered
        automatically in Jenkins which runs test suits.

    3.  Code modified by Fuzzer fails certain test cases. Following
        mutations are being used:

        1.  “&lt;” is replaced by “&gt;”

        2.  “&gt;” is replaced by “&lt;”

        3.  “== is replaced by “!=”

        4.  “!=” is replaced by “==”

        5.  “return -1” is replaced by “return 0”

        6.  “&lt;=” is replaced by “&gt;”

        7.  “&gt;=” is replaced by “&lt;”

    4.  Above mutations are causing about 100+ test case failures.

    5.  Report generated by fuzzer can be found at
        \[Fuzzer Report\](https://github.ncsu.edu/smsejwan/Devops\_Project/tree/Milestone\_2\_BuildTestAnalysis)

4.  Useless Testcase Detector:

    1.  We have built a utility which does 100+ iterations of build.

    2.  In each iteration, some mutations are applied randomly.

    3.  Our utility detects those test cases which always pass in all
        the iterations. These are useless test cases.

    4.  Report from the useless test detector can be found at: \[Useless
        Test
        Detector Report\](https://github.ncsu.edu/smsejwan/Devops\_Project/tree/Milestone\_2\_BuildTestAnalysis)
