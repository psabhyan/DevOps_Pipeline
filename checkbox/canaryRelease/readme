canaryRelease readme

- We created one new checkbox instances and termed it as Canary Release Production.
- We maintain two lists in redis,
    -  canaryList - will hold the IP address of canary production
     -  serverList -  will hove IP address of the all available stable checkbox instances.

- Implemented redirection mechanism such that 20% of the traffic will be directed to the Canary instance. This was implemented with the count variable which is incremented every time with the request. At a count value of 5, traffic will be directed to the canary release, otherwise it will be directed to any of the available stable instances.
- This Proxy server, will be parallely making request to canary server to verify its status at every 5 seconds. When this connection request is not successful which means the canary server is not up, an Alert will be raised. In case of Alert, proxy will not include canary server further into redirection of traffic and will direct traffic only to the stable staged servers. When the canary prod server is up again, Alert is dismissed and proxy will start redirecting 20% of its traffic to canary again.
