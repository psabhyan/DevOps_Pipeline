checkbox deployment


- Created .yml file to install all dependencies for the checkbox.io
- it will clone the git repo of checkbox.io and install forever tools to start the server.
- Git hooks are created in the local code repository and the bare repository.
- code repository /path/one/ - will have actual code repo where developer push their commits.
- remote is added to bare repository and post-receive hooks is set in bare repository to deploy code to /path/www/ folder.
- After deployment of code to /path/www/ folder, post-receive hook will also deploy the code from /www/ to remote running checkbox instances.
- Thus, every push into /path/one/ code repo, git hooks will deploy the code into production repository.
